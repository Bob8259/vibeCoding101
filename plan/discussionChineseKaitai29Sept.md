# GitHub Copilot Agent Workshop Discussion - September 29th

## Workshop Details
- **Date**: October 2nd, 2024
- **Time**: 3:30 PM
- **Location**: OEW 703
- **Target Audience**: Chinese Medicine students (mostly third-year students)
- **Duration**: 2+ hours

## Key Workshop Objectives

### 1. Introduction to GitHub Copilot Agent vs Traditional AI Chat
- **Main advantage**: AI can directly access and read files in a folder
- **Second benefit**: Can fetch and read web pages automatically
- **Third benefit**: Can directly edit documents (markdown, CSV files)
- **Fourth benefit**: Can write code to manipulate documents and create visualizations

### 2. Practical Use Cases to Demonstrate

#### File Processing
- Convert PDF/Word files to markdown format
- Use Python scripts to batch process multiple files
- Let AI analyze and summarize documents

#### Web Data Collection
- Teach students to use data.gov.hk for downloading datasets
- Use AI to fetch and process web information
- Demonstrate automated data collection without writing complex code

#### Document Manipulation
- Direct editing of markdown files
- Generate reports and summaries
- Create visualizations and charts
- Even generate PowerPoint presentations

### 3. Technical Setup Requirements

#### Student Preparation
- Students need to apply for GitHub education benefits
- Alternative: Provide shared API keys (with usage limits)
- Focus on getting students to experience the power of agent-based AI

#### Demo Environment
- Use computer lab with pre-installed software
- Students don't need to bring their own computers
- Prepare practical examples they can follow along with

### 4. Workshop Structure

#### Phase 1: Registration and Setup
- Help students register GitHub accounts
- Apply for education benefits
- Set up basic environment

#### Phase 2: Core Concepts
- Explain the difference between browser-based AI and agent-based AI
- Demonstrate file access capabilities
- Show web fetching capabilities

#### Phase 3: Hands-on Practice
- PDF to markdown conversion
- Data collection from data.gov.hk
- Document editing and manipulation
- Basic code generation for data processing

### 5. Key Teaching Points

#### Why Agent-Based AI is Better
- **Context awareness**: AI knows your entire project context
- **No context switching**: Work directly in your project environment
- **Automated workflows**: Can chain multiple operations together
- **File system integration**: Direct access to your documents

#### Practical Benefits for Students
- No need to copy-paste between browser and work environment
- AI can maintain context across multiple operations
- Can process multiple files automatically
- Can generate code for complex tasks

### 6. Follow-up Plans

#### Advanced Features (Future Sessions)
- API integration with different models
- Custom workflow creation
- Advanced data processing techniques
- Integration with external services

#### Assessment and Feedback
- Monitor student engagement during workshop
- Collect feedback on most useful features
- Plan follow-up sessions based on student needs

## Technical Notes from Meeting

### Current Development Status
- Working on essay editing system with three modes:
  1. Training mode
  2. Assessment mode  
  3. Report generation mode
- Issues with automatic essay updating need to be resolved
- Need to implement teacher-student email matching system

### Workshop Preparation Tasks
- [ ] Prepare demo materials (sample PDFs, datasets)
- [ ] Create step-by-step guides for students
- [ ] Test all examples beforehand
- [ ] Prepare backup plans for technical issues
- [ ] Set up shared API keys as backup option

## Success Metrics
- Students understand the difference between browser AI and agent AI
- Students can successfully complete at least one practical example
- Students are motivated to continue using GitHub Copilot Agent
- Students can see clear advantages over traditional AI chat methods

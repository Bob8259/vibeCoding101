#### 3.4 Article Summarization

- [ ] **Task**: Generate different types of summaries
- [ ] **Student Task**: Create executive summary, key points, and detailed summary
- [ ] **AI Suggestion**: "Request the Agent to create multiple summary formats: executive summary, bullet points, and detailed analysis"

#### 3.5 Student-Driven Exploration

- [ ] **Open Task**: Students suggest their own analysis tasks
- [ ] **Examples**:
  - Extract key statistics
  - Identify research gaps
  - Generate discussion questions
  - Create presentation slides
- [ ] **AI Suggestion**: "Think of a research question related to this article and ask the Agent to help you analyze it"

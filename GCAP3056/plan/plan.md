We need to create a jupyter notebook for students to work on

there should be two versions

student's work version - with some comments and suggestions for AI to generate codes or instructions

there should also be a full version that has got everything done

let's first generate a student's version and I will work through all the tasks

but before we generate the jupyter notebook we should have an outline first

let's create an outline here /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/ObSync/Vault4sync/GCAP3056/WorkshopGitHubCopilotAgent/outline4Jupyter.md

students will first learn the difference between talking to AI via browser vs agent

not sure if jupyter would support doing MC questions - there could be a task to set up the agent with instructions to login etc

then there should be a task to convert PDF to MD with a python codes /Users/simonwang/Documents/Usage/ObSync/Vault4sync/GCAP3056/WorkshopGitHubCopilotAgent/reviewArticle.pdf

then there should be a task to ask AI agent to clean up the markdown

once they have the cleaned MD we should then explore different tasks that AI can help such as extract all the citations and match with the reference 

summarize the article 

here students may come up with their own ideas 

we may also check out some github projects on scholarly research 



#### 4.1 Web Data Integration

- [ ] **Demo**: Using data.gov.hk with Agent
- [ ] **Task**: Fetch and process government data
- [ ] **Student Task**: Combine article insights with public data

let's replace this with API available from some open access literature database related to Chinese med
